# MealApp

This is an example project that is using a shared Kotlin Multiplatform project between an Android and an iOS project. The Android App UI is using Jetpack Compose  and the iOS App is using SwiftUI. Please be aware that i just started learning Compose and SwiftUI, so there are a lot of things to improve.

## iOS
Have tested it on XCode v12.

Just import the iOS project [iosApp](iosApp/) inside Xcode.

The iOS project compiles a Kotlin module to a framework (see [iosApp](iosApp/)). 

The iOS application is written with SwiftUI. It uses Kotlin module as a library.
Kotlin module is built into Objective-C framework by invoking Gradle
from custom "Run Script" build phase, and this framework is imported into
the Xcode project.

## Android 
The Android App is using Jetpack Compose for UI
You need to use [Android Studio Canary](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview) version. 

## Shared
The apps get their data from the Meal Api (https://www.themealdb.com). The complete Network Layer and Json Serialization for both apps is done in this module. It is using Ktor Clients and Kotlinx Serialization
